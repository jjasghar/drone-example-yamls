# drone.io example yamls

## Scope

Here are some generic [drone.io](https://drone.io) yamls to help you get started.
These are taken from my home lab, and are here if you need em.

## Examples

- [ansible.drone.yaml](./ansible.drone.yaml) - A simple example of running a linter against an `ansible` playbook.
- [kind-exec.drone.yaml](./kind-exec.drone.yaml) - An example of using both `docker` and `exec` runners to run [kind][kind] on a machine. (this also has an example of adding email notificaion to it too)
